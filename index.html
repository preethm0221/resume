  <h5>Engineer | Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) | 3D Model Creator | Embedded Systems Enthusiast</h5>
  <h4>I am an Electrical and Electronics Engineer who combines my technical acumen with creativity to find solutions for real-world problems. My journey is marked by experiences in the form of projects; grid synchronization using SOGI PLL is such an example, and so was a creative approach to learning and education through 3D modeling and animations.

    I simplify complicated EEE concepts through interactive 3D visualizations that will make the difference between theory and application. My website is a catch-all for educational content, featuring technical projects and personal creations aimed at empowering the learners and professionals in the field.
    
    As interest in designing an embedded system has been growing, I have constantly sought new technologies and looked for ways to develop solutions that make learning intuitive and impact-filled. Whether it is to design circuits, create animations, or dive into programming, the approach is dedicated to making technical knowledge easily accessible and engaging for everyone.</h4>
